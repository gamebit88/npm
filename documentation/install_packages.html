<p>If there is no package.json file in the local directory, the latest version of the package is installed.

If there is package.json file, the latest version satisfying the semver rule declared in package.json for that package (if there is any) is installed.</p>
<p>Using a package.json

The best way to manage locally installed npm packages is to create a package.json file.

A package.json file affords you a lot of great things:

It serves as documentation for what packages your project depends on.
It allows you to specify the versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules.
Makes your build reproducible which means that its way easier to share with other developers.</p>
